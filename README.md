### EzEncrypt - A OneTimePad Encryption Tool

This is a Python application using Tkinter for a simple One-Time Pad encryption and decryption.
# Features

  - Encrypt plaintext messages using a secret key.
  - Decrypt ciphertext messages using the same secret key.
  - User-friendly interface with labels and entry fields.
  - Error handling for empty fields.

# Requirements

  - Python 3
  - Tkinter (usually pre-installed with python3)
  - onetimepad library (install using pip install onetimepad)
  - sv_ttk library (install using pip install sv_ttk)

# Optional:

  - pyinstaller (for creating an executable, install using pip install pyinstaller)

# Usage

  - Install the required libraries (onetimepad and sv_ttk).
  - Run the script: python3 src/main.py
  - Enter your secret key in the "Secret Key" field.
  - Enter the plaintext message in the "Plain Text" field for encryption or ciphertext in the "Cipher Text" field for decryption.
  - Click "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" respectively.
  - The encrypted/decrypted message will appear in the corresponding field (readonly).

# Building an Executable (Optional)

You can create a standalone executable using pyinstaller:

`pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --collect-data sv_ttk src/main.py`

This will create an executable file in the dist folder.
